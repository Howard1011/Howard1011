## 🔭 Goals of 2022

Because of my love for Japanese anime, I hope to learn Japanese well in the new year, and my goal is to be able to roughly understand the content of the anime without subtitles💪.

Occasionally I use my spare time to record some clips of playing guitar and singing and upload them to my instagram.
